    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

            <p> Hello there! I’m a 3rd-year undergraduate at UC Berkeley double majoring in Computer Science and Physics. I’ve mentored students as an academic intern in Berkeley classes CS 61BL and CS 70, and I’ve been a marketing officer and graphic designer for the Berkeley IEEE student branch. </p>

            <p> Since middle school, I’ve always been interested in computer graphics, image processing, and simulations, and also the applications of machine learning to them all. I am particularly interested in algorithms pertaining to optics, fluid mechanics, pattern generation, and protein folding. </p>
        
            <p> Outside of study and work, I’ve learned piano and cello from a young age and had opportunities to perform across the world, and I’ve also practiced oil painting for a few years. Now I just casually produce music and paint, but I’m looking for new ways to bring computation into the creative, artistic process. I am currently developing novel algorithms for CGI. </p>
        
            <p> I love challenging projects in which I can apply every nook and cranny of my studies. Regardless of whether it’s art or science, I am always bridging the gap between different pieces of knowledge and experiences, so I can find new angles from which I will tackle my problem or towards where I will push my skills. </p>
            
            <p></p>

        <p> My current interests in computer graphics are Perlin noise tuning and stochastic-based Metropolis simulations. I've also dabbled in JavaScript game dev in high school. </p>
